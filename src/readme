N body simulation is simulation of n bodies in Universe.
The entire project is divided into 3 classes
1> Data type Body it has followinf attributes
  position x
  position y
  velocity x
  velocity y
  acceleration x
  acceleration y
  mass
2> World 
it stores all the bodies and computes gravitational forces among them
3> Nbody 
it takes coordinates from world and animates the output, with music

In order to run the project make sure you have
