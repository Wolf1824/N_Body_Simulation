# N_Body_Simulation
N body simulation is simulation of n bodies in Universe.
The entire project is divided into 3 classes
1. Data type Body it has followinf attributes\
  position x\
  position y\
  velocity x\
  velocity y\
  acceleration x\
  acceleration y\
  mass\
2. World 
it stores all the bodies and computes gravitational forces among them
3. Nbody it takes coordinates from world and animates the output, with music

Dependencies : Stdlib.jar \
All resources are in .idea//resources\
input and output file in .idea//resources\
copy paste initial coordinates in input filein the specified format\
end coordinates are pasted in output file\
